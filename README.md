Sorting Hat
=====
This sorting hat runs similarly to JK Rowling's Pottermore sorting hat. I created it using data from her quiz.

TO RUN IT:
Make sure all the files are in the same folder. 

Choose whether you'd like to run SuperHat or SortingHat:
  -SuperHat runs through every possible question. It's much longer, but much more accurate.
  -SortingHat gives you 7 randomly selected questions (more like the Pottermore quiz). It's quick but can be wrong.

Run either SuperHat.java or SortingHat.java.

Type in responses to questions as integers in the interactive shell.

Good luck!
